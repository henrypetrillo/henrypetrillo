  *I am still searching for a predictive model that can handle football stats, I am not at the level where I can build my own. My plan is to find an open source shell of a model than personalize it to fit into what I consider "valuable football stats" when it comes to football. As an example, I have PPG (Points Per Game) weighted at a higher percentage than Turnovers per Game.*
