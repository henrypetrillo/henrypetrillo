  *The application is still in the planning phase. I am working on the development aspects of the application while my friend helps with the business/management aspects of the project. It's something that I'm very excited to develop as it will force me to learn more about C, and potentially C++ and C# in order to make the best application possible.*

  *I am still searching for a predictive model that can handle football stats, I am not at the level where I can build my own. My plan is to find an open source shell of a model than personalize it to fit into what I consider "valuable football stats" when it comes to football. As an example, I have PPG (Points Per Game) weighted at a higher percentage than Turnovers per Game.*

  *I had created a program similar to this idea using C, however C is becoming an outdated language. I would like to update it to be written in Python. I have attached the repo [here](C:\Users\henry\Desktop\School\Spring 2023\CSIT 238 - C\Final Project)
